# Embedded Learning Journey ESP-IDF
This repo documents my personal journey to learning / practicing deeply embedded system

---

This is for my learning journey in Embedded System

## Purpose
- Practic low level embedded programing using ESP32 and ESP-IDF
- Rebuild foundation knowledge of microcontroller system
- Learn modular driver from stratch

---

## Roadmap
| Stage | Description|
|-------|------------| 
| **Peripheral Practice** | Low level priactice of GPIO, ADC, PWM, UART, I2C, etc. |
| **Modular Driver Buliding** | Implementing and testing sensor drivers in both **hardcoded** and **modular** formats using ESP-IDF component system. |
| **Project1** | Integrate multiple sensors/modules into a function embedded system |
| **ESP-IDF Special Features** | Explore deeper features like Wi-Fi, ESP-NOW, Deep Sleep, Interrupts, etc. |
| **Final Project** | Combine all concepts into larger system |

---

## Tools used 
- ESP32
- Arduino (Nano, Mega)
- Some kind sensors i have
- OS: Linux

## Repository Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `GPIO/`, `ADC`/, etc | peripheral learning practice file |
| `component/` | hardcoded and modular driver building file |

## Notes
Enjoy the process :)
