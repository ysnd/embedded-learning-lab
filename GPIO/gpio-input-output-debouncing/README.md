## Experiment
1. Toggle LED while button pressed.
2. Some issue in several advanced case like glitch in button state.
3. Detect button without debounce.
4. Implemented manual debounce using microsecoond time.

## Purpose
- Understanding GPIO mode Input and Output.
- Understanding bouncing effect and solution with software debounce.
