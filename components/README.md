# Components
This folder is for learning how to create libraries for ESP-IDF using several sensor i have.

---

## Structure
- `../[lib]/` Contains the libraries I create for my own components/sensors.
- `../example/` Contains example ESP-IDF projects that demonstrate how to use the libraries.
- `../manual-coded/` Contains projects components/sensors I have, written manually without using library. Used as a comparsion with modular.
